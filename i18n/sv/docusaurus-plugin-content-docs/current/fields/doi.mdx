# BibTeX field type: doi

``doi`` is used to store any DOI (Digital Object Identifier of the International DOI Foundation). DOI is a digital identifier that is intended to be permanent and unique. It is used, among other things, and mostly for articles from scientific journals. It can be used in ``article``, but more rarely also in ``chapter``, ``book``, or ``inproceedings`` / ``conference``. This field is optional in all cases.
