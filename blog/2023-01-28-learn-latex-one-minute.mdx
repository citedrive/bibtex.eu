## What is LaTeX?

LaTeX is a powerful typesetting system that is used to create professional-looking documents. It is particularly useful for creating technical and scientific documents, such as research papers and theses, as it includes features for creating complex layouts, such as tables and figures.

## Getting Started with LaTeX and Overleaf

To get started with LaTeX, you will need a LaTeX distribution, such as TeX Live or MikTeX, and a text editor, such as TeXworks or Sublime Text. But why settle for just a text editor when you can use Overleaf, the cloud-based LaTeX editor that makes it easy to create, edit, and collaborate on your LaTeX documents. With Overleaf, you can access your documents from any device, share your work with others, and even collaborate on the same document in real-time.

Once you have Overleaf and LaTeX distribution, you can begin creating your document. The process of creating a document in LaTeX is simple. First, you will write the text and formatting commands in a .tex file. Then, you will use the LaTeX distribution to create a typeset version of the document, usually in the form of a PDF.

Here is a simple example of a LaTeX document:

```tex
\documentclass{article} 
	\begin{document} Hello, this is a simple LaTeX document.
\end{document}
```

This is a basic structure of a LaTeX document and it's the starting point of any LaTeX document.
