Citing websites in LaTeX can be done in several ways depending on the bibliography style you use. In this guide, we cover the three most common approaches: using **BibTeX**, **BibLaTeX**, and **natbib**. For the easiest and most efficient method, we recommend using **CiteDrive**, which automatically creates and manages citations in the correct format.

## ðŸ“Œ The Easiest Way: Cite a Website in LaTeX with CiteDrive

{/*<CiteDrive />*/}

:::tip
[CiteDrive](https://www.citedrive.com/) is a web-based reference manager for BibTeX and BibLaTeX that syncs with [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/blog/citedrive-easy-reference-management-for-overleaf), [RStudio](https://citedrive.medium.com/bibliography-management-in-r-markdown-with-citedrive-and-rstudio-2585699dd619), and more. 

Its [browser extension](https://citedrive.medium.com/the-citedrive-companion-for-overleaf-and-rstudio-d8022adb9370) lets you save citations from academic websites and web pages directly into your BibTeX or BibLaTeX libraryâ€”complete with title, author, URL, and access date.

## ðŸ“š Method 1: Cite a Website Using BibTeX

If you're using classic **BibTeX**, the `@misc` entry type is commonly used for web sources. You can specify the URL and access date in the `note` or `howpublished` fields. To render clickable links, include `\usepackage{url}` in your preamble.

**Example with `note`:**

```bibtex
@misc{CiteDrive2022,
  title        = {CiteDrive brings reference management to Overleaf},
  author       = {CiteDrive, Inc},
  year         = 2022,
  note         = {\url{https://www.citedrive.com/overleaf} [Accessed: 2025-05-29]}
}
````

**Example with `howpublished`:**

```bibtex
@misc{CiteDrive2022,
  title        = {CiteDrive brings reference management to Overleaf},
  author       = {CiteDrive, Inc},
  year         = 2022,
  howpublished = {\url{https://www.citedrive.com/overleaf}},
  note         = {Accessed: 2025-05-29}
}
```

## âœ… Method 2: Cite a Website Using BibLaTeX (Recommended)

**BibLaTeX** simplifies citing websites with the `@online` entry type, which includes native fields for `url` and `urldate`. This is the cleanest and most accurate way to cite web pages in LaTeX.

```bibtex
@online{CiteDrive2022,
  title     = {CiteDrive brings reference management to Overleaf},
  author    = {CiteDrive, Inc},
  year      = 2022,
  url       = {https://www.citedrive.com/overleaf},
  urldate   = {2025-05-29}
}
```

## ðŸ§¾ Method 3: Citing Websites in LaTeX with `natbib`

If you're using **natbib**, it's important to know that natbib formats in-text citations but still relies on BibTeX in the background. That means you cite web pages the same way as shown aboveâ€”typically using the `@misc` entry.

You can then cite in your LaTeX document using:

```latex
\citet{CiteDrive2022}
```

or

```latex
\citep{CiteDrive2022}
```
