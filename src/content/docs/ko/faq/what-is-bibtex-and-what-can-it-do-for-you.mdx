BibTeX is a bibliography management tool designed for use with LaTeX, simplifying the creation and management of bibliographies. It allows you to generate citations and references for various sources such as articles, books, and websites. BibTeX files use the `.bib` file extension.

### Why Use BibTeX?

BibTeX is primarily used to create bibliographies and citations for LaTeX documents, a typesetting system widely used in disciplines like mathematics, physics, and computer science. However, its benefits have expanded into fields like psychology, biology, sociology, and law (e.g., with packages like jurabib). Additionally, BibTeX is utilized in tools like R Markdown through Pandoc-based systems.

### Managing Bibliographies with BibTeX

While some users maintain their bibliographic data manually, many prefer literature management software for efficiency. Tools like [CiteDrive](https://www.citedrive.com/) or JabRef are specifically tailored for BibTeX reference management, enabling users to search, import, and organize bibliographic data with ease. These tools also facilitate online collaboration, making them valuable for academic and professional research projects.
