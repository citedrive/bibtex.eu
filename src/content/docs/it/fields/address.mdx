## Detailed Overview

The `address` field is essential in pointing out the specific location details of the publishing entity or other significant institutions related to the citation. Often, the field may contain the city of publication, possibly followed by additional details depending on the region or specific citation requirements.

### Address Format Guidelines

#### American Publications

For sources published in the United States, the format usually includes the city's name, followed by the state's abbreviation according to the United States Postal Service (USPS) code enclosed in brackets.

> **Example**: "Columbus, Ohio" should be notated as "Columbus, OH."

#### European Publications

In contrast, European publications prefer the full representation of the state or province, without any abbreviation, followed by the country name.

> **Example**: A publication from Dusseldorf, Germany, would be denoted as "Dusseldorf, Germany."



## Examples and Usage Scenarios

  author  = {Arnold Peterson},
  title   = {My very own PhD-Thesis by Arnold Peterson},

  month   = 1,
  ...
