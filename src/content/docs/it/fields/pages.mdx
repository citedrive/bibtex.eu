The `pages` field in a BibTeX entry denotes the specific pages that are being referred to within a larger work, such as a book or journal. This field can be essential when citing a chapter of a book or an article in a journal, helping to point readers directly to the pertinent section of the work.

## Formatting Guidelines

You can specify a single page, a range of pages, or even non-consecutive pages. The recommended way to separate page numbers is either with commas or double dashes. Here are some guidelines to format the `pages` field properly:

1. **Single Page:** If referring to a single page, you simply write the page number.
    
2. **Range of Pages:** For a range of pages, you should use double dashes (--). This indicates a continuous range from the first number to the second.
    
3. **Non-consecutive Pages:** If referring to non-consecutive pages, separate the different page numbers or ranges with a comma.
    

## Examples

Here are some examples demonstrating how to use the `pages` field:

```bibtex
@book{key,
  title = {Title of the Book},
  author = {Author Name},
  year = {2023},
  pages = {33--44},   % Range of pages from 33 to 44
}
```


```bibtex
@book{key,
  title = {Title of the Book},
  author = {Author Name},
  year = {2023},
  pages = {22, 33--44},   % Page 22 and a range from 33 to 44
}
```

```bibtex
@book{key,
  title = {Title of the Book},
  author = {Author Name},
  year = {2023},
  pages = {17},    % Single page
}
```

## Note

It is important to note that the `pages` field is not limited to `@book` entries, and can also be used in other entry types like `@article` or `@inbook` to denote the relevant pages in those contexts. Using the `pages` field correctly helps to create more accurate and helpful citations.
