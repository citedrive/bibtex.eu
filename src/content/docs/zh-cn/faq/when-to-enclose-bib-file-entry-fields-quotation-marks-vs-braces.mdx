title: "When to Enclose .bib File Entry Fields: quotation marks vs. braces"
---

import CiteDrive from '@components/CiteDrive.astro';

Do you ever wonder when to enclose your .bib file entry fields with quotes and when to enclose them with braces? Do they even matter? The answer is: it doesn't matter.
Some people prefer to use "" simply for aesthetical reasons, and others prefer to use `{}`, arguing that it's preferable if you need to use a `"` character within a field.
Note, that these are the only acceptable ways to enclose fields.


<CiteDrive />

## Examples

### Enclosing fields with `{}`

```latex
@misc{CiteDrive2022,
	title        = {CiteDrive brings reference management to Overleaf},
	author       = {CiteDrive, Inc},
	year         = 2022,
	note         = {\url{https://www.citedrive.com/overleaf} [Accessed: (Use the date of access)]}
}
```

### Enclosing fields with `""`

```latex
@misc{CiteDrive2022,
	title        = "CiteDrive brings reference management to Overleaf",
	author       = "CiteDrive, Inc",
  ...
}
```

There is no right or wrong answer, as long as the information within the field is enclosed correctly. So why not experiment and see which method works best for you?
