In BibTeX, the `number` field is used to specify the issue number of a journal, the number of a technical report, or other identifiers that are part of a larger series. This field helps to pinpoint the exact issue or edition of a series where the referenced work can be found, providing more precise information for locating the material.

<CiteDrive />

This field is commonly used in conjunction with the `volume` field, especially for journal articles and periodicals. For a technical report, the `number` field would typically contain the report number assigned by the institution or organization that published the report.

## Format

The format for the `number` field is relatively straightforward. In the context of an article entry, it would appear as follows:

```bibtex
@article{citation_key,
  ...
  number={issue_number},
  ...
}

```

Here, "citation_key" represents a unique identifier for the entry, and "issue_number" represents the number of the journal issue, technical report, or other publication.

## Examples

Below are some examples showcasing the application of the `number` field in different contexts:

### Example 1: Journal Article

```bibtex
@article{doe2023study,
  author = {Doe, Jane},
  title = {A Comprehensive Study on Quantum Computing},
  journal = {Journal of Advanced Computing},
  year = {2023},
  volume = {29},
  number = {3},
  pages = {215-230},
}

```

In this example, the `number` field specifies the third issue of the 29th volume of the "Journal of Advanced Computing".

### Example 2: Technical Report

```bibtex
@techreport{smith2022analysis,
  author = {Smith, John},
  title = {An Analysis of Renewable Energy Trends},
  institution = {Energy Research Institute},
  year = {2022},
  number = {TR-2022-45},
  type = {Technical Report},
}
```

In this case, the `number` field is used to indicate the specific report number assigned by the "Energy Research Institute".

Utilizing the `number` field accurately can facilitate the reader in finding the source material more easily and verifying the cited information. It's an essential detail in scholarly writing and research documentation.
